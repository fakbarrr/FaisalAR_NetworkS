Background
 At this time many network security becomes very important and noteworthy, networks connected to the internet is basically insecure and always can be exploited by hackers, network either wired LAN or wireless LAN. At the time the data is sent will pass through some of the terminal to reach the destination means it will give a chance to other users who are not responsible for intercepting or alter the data.
Explanation
Sniffing According to Science is an activity that is done to tap the network with the network state that is very difficult to prevent. with it although we have installed a variety of software to prevent terror or attacks on the network. This problem is not related to system o [constellation because weve like that in the science of network sniffing.
There are 2 maca sniffing namely:
1. Passive Sniffing
A process of wiretapping without changing any data or packet network. Passive sniffing is often done that in the Hub, haltersebut is caused due to the performance of the hub which only served to forward the signal to all computers (broadcast), some programs are generally used for this activity is wireshark.
2. Active sniffing
Sniffing process that can change the data packets in the network in order to make sniffing, sniffing active is the opposite of passive sniffing. Active sniffing is generally done on a switch, this is due to differences in the basic working principle between the Hub and Switch.
Two types of sniffing is very harmful if it occurs in our network because of the personal data of its private nature it could have been stolen because it was recommended in the liver Hatti for two types of sniffing at the top do not have a safe solution if the data to be returned.
Scenarios are created:
1. Network wifi on the laptop campus students and student laptop will automatically be incorporated in a single access (lecturer Nebeng)
2. Students investigate Sniffer in laptops (data lecturers who had nebeng in our hotspot / Laptop Kita)
3. Lecturer Hotspot Login (it means that lecturers put wifi network packets form of user passwords html form method, post) was in jelasin login picture above.
4. Sniffer captures data on student laptop lecturers
5. And students can take the user / pass lecturer who've nebeng wifi hotspot or nebeng in student laptop.
